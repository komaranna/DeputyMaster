# DeputyMaster
Deputy (Dungeon) Master for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5

Deputy Master (DM) allows the Dungeon Master to focus more on the important stuff during battle –- by rolling the rolls for you, and keeping track of various stats and status effects of each monster you’re controlling. 

You will only need to prepare a text file for each monster in your battle, and Deputy Master does the rest for you.

For more details, including setup and the developer's guide, please see the User's Manual (manual.pdf)

The folder "christmas" contains example text files.
